# LeetCode-Practice
Personal notes used as reference to practive for technical interviews and to solifidy my understanding of Algorithms and Data Structures. The mostly are mostly written using Jupyter Notebook, I prefer this tool because it acts  as (some sort of ) second brain, I can both write theoretical content, as well as practice without having to refer to other tools or frameworks. 
The following study plan was based on the https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-study-plan/ 
A well structured study plan specially for people that are busy with some other projects and cannot dedicate 8 hours of their day "grinding on leetcode".
